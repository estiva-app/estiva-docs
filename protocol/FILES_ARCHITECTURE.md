# Folders, Files and Components — working through the git model

Response to the proposal that **git provides folders and files**, leaving only
Components to design, split into **static** (markup) and **dynamic** (widgets).

**Verdict: the proposal is right, it is better than [NIP-FC](nips/NIP-FC.md),
and it makes NIP-FC largely unnecessary.** Details below, including what it
costs and the one place it genuinely leaves a gap.

## Reviewed 2026-09-05 — two things below are now wrong, and one unit is undecided

Read this first. The document is otherwise current, and these three corrections
are the parts that would send somebody in the wrong direction.

**1. §3's "cut static components" was overtaken by what shipped.** This document
says a heading is a line of Markdown and needs no address. [RFC 0.4](RFC-0.4-WORKSPACE.md)
§6 then revived components *for anchoring only*, and RIC-5 answered it a third
way: **a block document in JSON, where every block carries an id**, running in
Ship's descriptions today with anchored comments on top of it (RIC-7). So §7's
row *"comment on part of a file — git line-ranges, or revisit Components —
open"* is **answered, and by neither of the options it lists.** Line ranges lost
for the reason this document already gives — they are famously fragile across
edits — and separate Component events lost to ids inside the content.

That also removes the objection §3 raises. Block ids are not "an event per
heading"; they are a field in the body, minted once and stable across edits.

**2. Events and git are not competing, and the split is not primary/backup.**
The line that matters:

> **Events** carry a file's identity, properties and state. **Git** carries
> content where concurrent edits must merge.

Every file has a Nostr record regardless — that is what gives it an address to
link to, a type, a projection other apps render it through, and a status
somebody who is *not* the author can set. Git holds bytes underneath, for the
one thing events genuinely cannot do: §2's own point, that a file edited by two
people is two addresses under `(pubkey, kind, d)`.

The test for a given file is *does more than one person edit this same text at
once and need both edits kept?* A project description: no, so an event. A design
document three people are writing: yes, so git.

**3. The unit is undecided, and this document says both.** §5 of RFC 0.4 gives a
doc the address `30617:<pk>:<repo-d>` — a **repository**. §7 below says folders
are git **trees** and files are **blobs**. Those are different designs, and
nothing chooses.

**Proposed, not decided: one repo per team.** A team's Folder is one repository;
files whose content wants history are paths inside it; files that do not stay as
plain events. It makes §7's *"folders are git trees"* literally true, it costs
one repo per team rather than one per file, and it lines up with the permission
model §1 records — **channel role = repo role** — so a team's git permissions
are already its channel's, with nothing to bridge.

**The gap it needs, and this is a third sighting of the same gap.** A manifest
can say a file's body is in the event's `content`. It cannot say *"the body is
at this path in the team's repo."* That is the same shape as `target: "content"`
in `@estiva-app/interop` 0.13.0, which declares where a value is written —
and the same shape as the missing declaration behind labels and behind one team
pointing at another team's files. Three features now want the manifest to say
something it cannot.

## 1. "Buzz is using git on Nostr" — confirmed, and further along than assumed

Not patch-exchange-over-Nostr. **Real git hosting.**

`crates/buzz-relay/src/api/git/transport.rs` implements the git **Smart HTTP**
protocol:

```
GET  /git/{owner}/{repo}/info/refs        ref advertisement
POST /git/{owner}/{repo}/git-upload-pack  clone / fetch
POST /git/{owner}/{repo}/git-receive-pack push
```

Authenticated with **NIP-98 on every route**, including clone. You can
`git clone` and `git push` against a Buzz relay with a Nostr key.

**Permissions already exist, and are already unified.** From
`crates/buzz-core/src/git_perms.rs`:

> "The permission model: **channel role = repo role**; `buzz-protect` tags on
> kind:30617 add constraints that apply to everyone (including the owner)."

So repo access *is* channel membership — one permission system, not two. Plus
branch-protection rules declared as tags on the NIP-34 repo announcement. That is
further than "permissions are also doable": it is done, and done the way the RFC
wants (one identity, one permission model, many surfaces).

---

## 2. Why git is the better substrate — including for the thing I could not solve

I flagged one central unresolved problem in NIP-FC:

> NIP-33 addresses are `(pubkey, kind, d)`, so a File edited by two people is two
> addresses. Fine for a single-author document, **wrong for the collaborative
> case this NIP exists to serve.**

**Git solves exactly this, and has for twenty years.** Concurrent edits merge
rather than clobber. Nostr addressable events give you last-write-wins per
author; git gives you a merge model, conflict markers, and a history that
survives disagreement.

That one fact is close to decisive on its own.

What else comes free:

| Need | Under git | Under NIP-FC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Folders** | Native, hierarchical | Not modelled at all |
| **History** | Real: diffs, blame, branches | "Latest event wins" + scraping the log |
| **Multi-writer** | Merge | **Unsolved** |
| **Permissions** | Already built, = channel role | Not designed |
| **Large/binary files** | Known problem with known answers | Blossom, separately |

### And it answers §1.3 almost by accident

RFC §1.3 says: *"a File can belong to more than one org… exists on each
participating org's relay… no host database and no org that 'owns' the shared
project — each side holds its own copy."*

**That is a description of `git clone`.** Distributed copies, no central owner,
each side keeps its copy if the relationship ends — git's design brief.

One consequence to be explicit about: under this model files replicate by **git
push/pull, not by relay event sync**. NIP-77 Negentropy stops being the
interesting mechanism for files (it remains relevant for messages). Cross-org
file sharing becomes "a remote you are allowed to fetch from", which is a much
better-understood problem than inventing replication.

---

## 3. Static vs dynamic — the sharpest part of the proposal

This distinction is what collapses most of NIP-FC.

### Static components are not protocol

`h1`, `h2`, paragraph, table, list. These are **markup**. If a File is a git
blob, a heading is a line of Markdown. It does not need an event, an address, a
kind, or a registry.

NIP-FC made every heading a separately addressable Nostr event. Re-reading it
against this proposal, that is a lot of machinery to make a `##` addressable, and
it buys almost nothing: nobody needs to permission a heading or subscribe to it.

**Cut them.** Static structure is the file format's job.

### Dynamic components are the actual protocol work

A Linear ticket. A project with a filtered issue table. Your framing has two
parts and both are right:

1. **How it looks** — the rendering contract
2. **How to get current data** — the reference to resolve

The second is why this is not an embed or a screenshot. The document stores a
*pointer*; render time resolves it. That is what makes the widget live, and it is
the whole "components from other apps" claim in RFC §3.1.

---

## 4. What a dynamic component needs — mostly nothing new

Decomposing it against the NIP corpus:

| Part | Mechanism | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Point at another app's object | `nostr:naddr…` / `nostr:nevent…` inline | ✅ **NIP-21** (URI scheme) + **NIP-19** (encoding) |
| Reference it from document text | ✅ **NIP-27** — text note references, exactly this pattern |
| Point at a *query*, not one object | a filter — needs a shape, but nothing new conceptually | 🔧 |
| Know which app owns that kind | ✅ **NIP-89** `kind:31990` handler declarations |
| Registry of available widgets | ✅ NIP-89 *is* the registry — your point 4 |
| **How to render it inline** | ❌ **the gap** — see below |

So a file could be Markdown containing `nostr:naddr1…`, and a client that
understands NIP-27 already knows that is a reference, and NIP-89 already tells it
which app handles that kind.

### The one genuine gap

**NIP-89 declares how to *open* an event in an app, not how to *render* it
inline.** Its `kind:31990` is about redirect targets — "open this in Linear at
this URL". A widget needs something else: an embeddable rendering.

That is the NIP to write, and it is small and well-scoped:

> Given a `nostr:` reference and a viewer that cannot interpret its kind, how
> does the owning app supply an inline rendering?

Candidate answers worth weighing: a declared iframe/embed URL; a data-shape
contract plus a viewer-supplied template; a signed HTML/JSON fragment. Each has
different trust and offline properties — an iframe hands the owning app your
render surface, a data contract keeps rendering local but constrains what the
widget can be.

**Naming it precisely: this is an embed extension to NIP-89, not a new document
model.** Far easier to propose than a File kind, and it is the thing your
scenarios actually need.

---

## 5. What this costs, honestly

The git model is better, not free.

- **A call summary becomes a git commit.** Heavier than publishing an event, and
  it needs a repo to exist first. Scenario 1's Meet app would need to commit and
  push rather than publish.
- **Reading a file is a git fetch, not a relay `REQ`.** Every client needs git
  access or the relay's HTTP git API. That is a real client-side cost, and it
  makes "just subscribe to everything" no longer true for files.
- **Frequent small edits are awkward.** Git commits are not keystrokes, so an
  app has to decide when to commit — see §6.
- **Discovery changes.** Finding files means listing a repo, not filtering
  events. Relay-side search (NIP-50) does not see inside git blobs.
- **Comments on part of a file lose their anchor.** Git has no addressable
  sub-file unit. GitHub solves this with `(commit, path, line-range)` and it is
  famously fragile across edits. This is the one place NIP-FC's addressable
  Components were genuinely better — worth revisiting if Scenario 2's pinned
  comments prove painful.

---

## 6. Real-time editing is deliberately app-local

Your point 2 — *"any kind of files is git versioned; separate things are messages
and discussion"* — raises the obvious objection: what about a Figma canvas or a
Google Doc, where several people type at once?

**The answer is that this does not belong on Nostr at all**, and that is a
principle rather than a workaround.

### Nothing available solves it anyway

Checked, not assumed:

| | Real-time co-editing |
| --- | --- |
| Git | No — but it merges, and keeps history |
| Buzz canvas (`kind:40100`) | No — `UPDATE channels SET canvas = $1`, a plain overwrite. Last writer silently erases the other |
| Any of the 99 NIPs | Does not exist. No CRDT, Automerge, Yjs or operational-transform mechanism anywhere |

So this is not a git shortcoming. Buzz's canvas is *worse* — git at least reports
a conflict instead of discarding someone's work.

### And it should not

An app building Figma-on-NfB would use its own real-time mechanism — a CRDT over
a websocket, whatever suits — and publish to Nostr **when there is something
worth committing.** Nothing is lost by that, and it follows directly from the
rule already adopted:

> Publish completed business actions that other apps need. Keep per-viewer
> state, derived state, and routing decisions local.

Keystrokes and cursor positions are the purest possible case of ephemeral local
state. A character typed is not a business action; a saved document is. Signing
and storing an event per keystroke would be absurd on any substrate.

This is also exactly how git already works: your editor does not commit every
keystroke. The commit is the unit that means something, and the same boundary
applies here.

**Interop lives at the commit boundary.** Another app does not need your
keystrokes — it needs the document. Publishing at the commit gives full
interoperability with none of the cost.

### Two small consequences

1. **Presence is a separate question, and is worth having.** Knowing *that* Ana
   is editing — as opposed to receiving her keystrokes — is genuinely useful
   across apps, and Nostr already carries it: `kind:20001` presence and
   `kind:20002` typing indicators, both ephemeral and never stored. So "who is
   in this document right now" can be shared without the editing traffic being
   shared.
2. **Each app must choose its commit boundary.** Commit on every pause and the
   history becomes noise; commit only on explicit save and collaborative context
   is lost. That is an application decision, but a demo should pick something
   deliberate rather than accidental.

## 7. Where this leaves the design

| Layer | Answer | New protocol? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Folders | git tree | **No** |
| Files | git blob | **No** |
| History / revision | git | **No** |
| Permissions on files | Buzz: channel role = repo role | **No — already built** |
| Cross-org file sharing | git remotes | **No** (policy still open) |
| Static components | markup in the file | **No — not protocol** |
| Dynamic component: which object | `nostr:` URI, NIP-21/19/27 | **No** |
| Dynamic component: which app | NIP-89 | **No** |
| **Dynamic component: inline rendering** | — | **Yes — one small NIP** |
| Live collaborative editing | **App-local by design** (§6) | **No — deliberately out of scope** |
| Knowing who is editing now | `kind:20001` / `20002`, ephemeral | **No** |
| Comment on part of a file | git line-ranges, or revisit Components | Open |

**One new NIP instead of a document model.** That is a much better place to be
than where NIP-FC left things.

---

## 8. Consequences for what has been built

- **NIP-FC is superseded for Files and Folders.** Keep the draft as a record of
  the reasoning — its "Open Questions" section is what led here — but it should
  not be proposed. Its one surviving idea is addressable sub-file units for
  comment anchoring (§5).
- **The Meet app currently publishes a File + Components** (`kind:30840/30841`).
  Under this model it should commit Markdown to a repo instead. That is a rewrite
  of the publish path, not of the app.
- **The two relay patches stay useful.** `kind:9802` (NIP-84) is unaffected and
  ratified. `30840/30841` would become dead if this model is adopted — worth
  keeping on the branch until the decision is firm.

## 9. What to check next

Before committing to this, two things are worth verifying rather than assuming:

1. **Can a Buzz repo actually be created and pushed to from a script?** The
   transport is there; the provisioning path (`kind:30617` announcement → repo
   exists → push accepted) has not been exercised here.
2. **What does a Peek user's git identity look like?** Clone and push are NIP-98
   authenticated, so the same key custody question applies — and
   `git-credential-nostr` exists in the Buzz repo, which suggests the answer is
   already designed.
