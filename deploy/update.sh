# Pull-based deploy. Runs on the box from a systemd timer; nothing connects in.
#
# Same shape as Estiva Ship's update.sh — a static site has no schema, so there
# is no migration step. The lessons encoded here were paid for once already, so
# they are kept rather than simplified away:
#
#   * compare image IDs, because `docker compose pull` is silent about whether
#     anything changed;
#   * `--force-recreate`, because compose compares the *service definition* and
#     a new image behind an unchanged `:main` tag does not change it;
#   * verify the running container is the image just pulled, because "healthy"
#     and "updated" are different claims and only one of them is being tested.
#
# One difference from the others: this image is PRIVATE on GHCR, so the box
# needs a registry login for the pull to work. If `docker compose pull` starts
# failing with `denied`, the token has expired — see deploy/README.md.
